# CSE 301 Final Project

Team Members: Pedro Cabral, Doan Dai Nguyen, Mark Daychman.

## Structure

We implemented the required functionality in the Eval and Subst sections. Moreover, MyLambda now is compatible with PrettyExpr.

As an extension, we implemented the left/right arrow handler with the NCurses library. Now the user can move the cursor anywhere in the line and edit the current expression.
